# Preseed Configuration Files for DebianInstaller

## Description
One of The Debian Project's most powerful features is the ability to customize and automate installations using the DebianInstaller system.  Many Debian-based GNU/Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, use DebianInstaller (or some derivitative) for system installation.  The configuration file to customize and automate the DebianInstaller is known as a preseed file.  This repository includes customized preseed files for use at FreeGeek Chicago. YMMV.
